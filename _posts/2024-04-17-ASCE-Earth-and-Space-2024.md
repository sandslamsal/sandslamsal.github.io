## Overview

Yesterday, I had the privilege of presenting our latest research on "A Sustainable and Efficient Structural Solution for Hybrid Coral Reefs" at the ASCE Earth and Science 2024 conference. This presentation focused on the innovative SEAHIVE® system—a shoreline-protection strategy that combines hexagonal concrete prisms to dissipate wave energy and support marine habitats.

## Research Highlights

Our study assesses the protective performance of both solid and perforated SEAHIVE® structures in mitigating wave impacts. We've conducted extensive scaled testing at the University of Miami's Alfred C. Glassell Jr. SUSTAIN Laboratory to understand how these structures can best serve coastal defense while promoting ecological growth.


## Key Findings

1. **Energy Dissipation:** Perforated SEAHIVE® units demonstrated up to 45% more energy dissipation compared to solid structures, providing significant protection with lower material use.
2. **Ecological Benefits:** The design encourages biodiversity, turning functional breakwaters into thriving marine habitats.
3. **Design Flexibility:** SEAHIVE® can be configured in various layouts to optimize protection based on local wave and water conditions.

## Conclusion

The positive reception to our presentation reaffirms the potential of SEAHIVE® technology in coastal engineering. The blend of functionality and sustainability addresses critical needs in shoreline protection and ecological preservation.

I am grateful for the insightful discussions and feedback from the conference attendees, which will undoubtedly help refine our ongoing research.

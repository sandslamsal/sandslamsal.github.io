At the 16th National Civil Engineering Cum held at IOE Pulchowk Campus, our team unveiled a groundbreaking proposal aimed at alleviating urban congestion and parking woes in Newroad, Nepal. With a strategic vision and meticulous planning, we introduced a design concept for a seven-story parking building situated near the Sukraraj Shastri statue, utilizing an open governmental plot area.
Newroad, a bustling commercial hub in Nepal, grapples with severe traffic congestion and a scarcity of parking spaces. Recognizing the pressing need for a sustainable solution, our team embarked on a mission to revolutionize urban parking infrastructure.
Our proposal entails the construction of a multi-story parking building to accommodate a significant number of vehicles efficiently. Through extensive traffic surveys and analysis, we meticulously evaluated the area's traffic patterns and parking demands. The proposed seven-story structure was strategically designed to optimize space utilization while adhering to safety and regulatory standards.
The structural integrity of the parking building was of paramount importance. Leveraging advanced engineering techniques, including Response Spectrum Analysis based on prevailing NBC and IS standards, our team devised a robust structural design capable of withstanding seismic forces and ensuring long-term durability.
A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis underscored the economic viability and societal impact of our parking solution. By quantifying the projected benefits in terms of reduced traffic congestion, improved accessibility, and enhanced urban aesthetics, we demonstrated the immense value proposition of the proposed investment.
Our success in conceptualizing and presenting this transformative parking solution would not have been possible without the invaluable guidance and support of key stakeholders. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to Er. Hemant Tiwari, our esteemed guidance and academic coordinator, whose mentorship was instrumental throughout the project. Special thanks are also due to the NCE-Robotics Club and CESS (Civil Engineering Students' Society-NCE) for their unwavering support and encouragement.
We were also fortunate to present our proposal to our esteemed ex-prime minister and renowned architect, Dr. Babu Ram Bhattarai, whose insights and feedback enriched our understanding and strengthened our resolve to contribute meaningfully to urban development in Nepal.
In conclusion, our proposal for a multi-story parking building in Newroad embodies the spirit of innovation and proactive urban planning. By harnessing civil engineering expertise and collaborative efforts, we aspire to create tangible solutions that enhance the quality of life for residents and visitors alike. Together, let us pave the way for a more sustainable and vibrant urban future.

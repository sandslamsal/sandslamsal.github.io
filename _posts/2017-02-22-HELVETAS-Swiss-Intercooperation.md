In the final year of our Bachelor of Civil Engineering program in Nepal, we were fortunate to receive the support of HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation. This organization, dedicated to the development and implementation of projects that change the lives of people in developing countries, provided us with the necessary resources to complete our thesis project.

Our project focused on the design of two different trail bridges in Nepal: a suspended bridge at Panga, Kritipur, and a suspension bridge at Madaiyatapanpur, Sarlahi. These bridges are not just structures; they are lifelines that connect communities, facilitate trade, and provide access to essential services like healthcare and education.

HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation provided us with technical books, training, and the opportunity to visit the actual sites of these bridges. This hands-on experience was invaluable. It allowed us to understand the practical challenges that come with bridge construction in the diverse geographical and climatic conditions of Nepal.

The bridges at Panga and Madaiyatapanpur are particularly important due to their locations. Panga, a historical town in the Kathmandu Valley, is a bustling hub of activity. The bridge here improves local transportation and supports the town's economic activities. On the other hand, Madaiyatapanpur in Sarlahi, a district in the Terai plains, is a rural area where the bridge significantly enhances connectivity for the local farming communities.

Our project was supervised by Sushil Kumar Bhandari, whose guidance was instrumental in the successful completion of our thesis. The financial support from HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation made it possible for us to undertake this project, which has not only contributed to our academic growth but also to the development of our communities.

In conclusion, the support from HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation was more than just financial. It was an opportunity for us to apply our theoretical knowledge in a real-world context, understand the socio-economic impact of our work, and contribute to the development of our country. We are grateful for this experience, which has shaped us as engineers and as individuals committed to the progress of Nepal.

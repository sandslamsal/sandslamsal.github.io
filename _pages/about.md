Dr. Sandesh Lamsal is a Structural Engineer based in Florida, USA. He holds a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the [University of Miami](https://welcome.miami.edu/), specializing in Structural Engineering under the mentorship of [Dr. Landolf Rhode-Barbarigos](https://people.miami.edu/profile/fd82d399a0cf413f7d86bdb483184796).  

He has successfully passed the PE Civil: Structural exam from NCEES and holds an Engineer Intern (EI) certification from the Florida Board of Professional Engineers. He is currently working as an Engineer II at AtkinsRéalis, designing federal bridge infrastructure in compliance with AASHTO LRFD standards, and also serves as a researcher at the CASE Lab at the University of Miami.  

Dr. Lamsal’s academic journey began with a Bachelor's Degree in Civil Engineering from [Tribhuvan University](https://tu.edu.np/) and a Master of Science in Civil Engineering from [Texas Tech University](https://www.ttu.edu/). Prior to his graduate studies in the U.S., he worked as a Structural Engineer in Nepal, specializing in the design of buildings, bridges, and tensile membrane structures.  

His doctoral research focused on the morphological investigation and physical testing of submerged structures at the University of Miami’s Alfred C. Glassell, Jr. Surge-Structure-Atmosphere Interaction [(SUSTAIN)](https://sustain.earth.miami.edu/) Laboratory. He played a key role in the DARPA-funded REEFENSE (X-REEFS) project, advancing the performance and design of SEAHIVE® modular breakwaters for enhanced coastal resilience.  

With professional and academic experience spanning from bridge design to coastal infrastructure, Dr. Lamsal is passionate about developing innovative, sustainable engineering solutions. Outside of work, he actively engages in the engineering community and contributes to knowledge-sharing through research publications and technical presentations.

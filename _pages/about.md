Structural Engineer, researcher and a Ph.D. student in Civil and Architectural Engineering at University of Miami, degree candidate with the class of 2025. Before coming to UMiami, he did his MS in Civil Engineering in Texas Tech University and worked as a Civil/Structural Design Engineer in Nepal. Pulling from this professional experience and a BS in Civil Engineering, he's exploring the integration of structural engineering, urban ecosystems and environmental fluid mechanics. His research, advised by [Dr. Landolf Rhode-Barbarigos (CASE Lab)](http://umcaselab.com), focuses on wave-structure interaction and the design of nature-based coastal protection strategies. By applying knowledge of biophysical interactions in aquatic ecosystems to urban waterfront design, he investigates ways climate adaptation can strengthen a multispecies understanding of coastal community resilience. In addition to his research, he is also involved in studying the combination of wind and wave loading effects in building structures and considerations for prevailing building design codes within his team. Sandesh is an active member of the UM Grad community, ASCE Students Society, and the Graduate Student Association.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

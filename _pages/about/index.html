Before coming to UMiami, he did his MS in Civil Engineering in Texas Tech University and worked as a Civil/Structural Design Engineer in Nepal. Pulling from this professional experience and a BS in Civil Engineering, he’s exploring the integration of structural engineering, urban ecosystems and environmental fluid mechanics. His research, advised by <a href="https://people.miami.edu/profile/fd82d399a0cf413f7d86bdb483184796" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Landolf Rhode-Barbarigos (CASE Lab)</a>, focuses on wave-structure interaction and the design of nature-based coastal protection strategies. By applying knowledge of biophysical interactions in aquatic ecosystems to urban waterfront design, he investigates ways climate adaptation can strengthen a multispecies understanding of coastal community resilience. In addition to his research, he is also involved in studying the combination of wind and wave loading effects in building structures and considerations for prevailing building design codes within his team. Sandesh is an active member of the UM Grad community, ASCE Students Society, and the Graduate Student Association.</p> </body></html>

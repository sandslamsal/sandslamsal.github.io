<span style="font-size: 1.5em;"> **Steel Warehouse Design addressing Wind Load and Earthquake Load**</span>

This tutorial was made in 2019 and is in the Nepali language. It was created during a training session for students. The tutorial covers the design of a steel warehouse, with a focus on analyzing the effects of wind and earthquake loads.

In Nepal we use Indian Standard IS-875 for wind load which is the standard in India for design loads (other than earthquake) for buildings and structures. Basic wind speed as applicable to 10 m height above mean ground level for different zones in the country can be directly calculated if the proper value is defined in the Wind Zone Number box. Indian Standard IS-1893 Part 1 2016 along with NBC2020 is used for earthquake load analysis. The standard provides the minimum design force for earthquake resistant design of special structures (such as large and tall buildings, large and high dams, long-span bridges and major industrial projects).
